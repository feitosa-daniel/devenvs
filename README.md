# Development Environments

This repository contains a number of pre-cooked [Docker](https://www.docker.com) containers for various purposes (general development, notebook, education, writing, etc.). 

This repository was born out of struggles to find similar resources. So, any contributions are very welcome.

## Containers (A-Z)

- `cpp-competition`: GNU C++ used in competitions.

- `cpp-jupyterlab`: JupyterLab notebook with xeus-cling kernel for C++.

- `ijava-jupyterlab`: JupyterLab notebook with iJava kernel.

- `java`: Generic Java 17 environment.

- `jekyll`: Jekyll website template

- `latex`: Compile latex projects.

- `python-jupyterlab-bokeh`: JupyterLab with Python kernel + package to use Bokeh. The container is also built to support SVG export using selenium.  

- `python-jupyterlab-nlp`: JupyterLab with Python kernel + common packages for NLP. 

- `python-poetry`: Generic Python environment using poetry as the build system.
